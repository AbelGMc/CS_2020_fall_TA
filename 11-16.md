## 1.  Eigenvalue algorithm

Given a symmetric matrix $A\in\R^{n\times n}$ with $n$ different eigenvalues, write a program to compute its eigenvalues and eigenvectors in Armadillo. Equivalently, approximately find its eigendecomposition:
$$
A = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i u_iu_i^T,\ \ \ (\lambda_i\not=\lambda_j\ , \forall i\not= j)
$$
You can use **power iteration algorithm** as follows:

 Starts with a vector $ b_{0}$. The method is described by the recurrence relation
$$
b_{k+1}=\frac{A b_{k}}{\left\|A b_{k}\right\|}
$$

$$
\mu_{k}=b_{k}^{T} A b_{k}
$$

Under some conditions, $\mu_k,b_k$ converges to the dominant eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector.



Check your algorithm by generating a $3\times 3$ random matrix $A$ with standard normal entries and then set $A = A + A^T$. Compare your result with ```eig_sym()``` in Armadillo.

## 2. Generating gaussian distribution

(a)

Write a program to generate standard normal sample using uniform random sample generator(for example, ```randu()``` in Armadillo or ```uniform_dist``` in trng). This can be done by following **Boxâ€“Muller transform**:

Given $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$ independently from $\text{Uniform}(0,1)$.

Consider polar coordinates $(R,\Theta)$ for independent standard normal $(Z_0,Z_1)$. we know $R^2\sim \chi^2_2$ and $\Theta\sim \text{Uniform}(0,2\pi)$, thus generate $R$ and $\Theta$ by:
$$
R = \sqrt{-2 \ln U_{1}} \\
\Theta = 2\pi U_2
$$
Then independent standard normal $(Z_0,Z_1)$ can be obtained by
$$
Z_{0}=R \cos (\Theta)=\sqrt{-2 \ln U_{1}} \cos \left(2 \pi U_{2}\right)\\
Z_{1}=R \sin (\Theta)=\sqrt{-2 \ln U_{1}} \sin \left(2 \pi U_{2}\right)
$$
(b) 

Why your generated $Z_0$ and $Z_1$ are actually truncated? (hint: for a computer, there is a smallest non-zero number)
